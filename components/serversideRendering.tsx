      <p>
        One of the core features of Next.js is Server-Side Rendering (SSR), which enables web pages to be rendered on 
        the server and delivered to the client. SSR improves performance and search engine optimization (SEO), making it 
        a popular choice for building fast, dynamic applications.
      </p>
      <h2>What is SSR?</h2>
      <p>
        SSR allows pages to be rendered on the server on each request, rather than on the clientâ€™s browser. This means 
        that when a user visits a page, they get the fully-rendered HTML instead of waiting for JavaScript to execute 
        on their browser.
      </p>
      <h2>Benefits of SSR</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Improved SEO: Search engines can easily index server-rendered HTML, improving a site's search rankings.</li>
        <li>Faster Time to Interactive: Users can see the content sooner, improving their experience.</li>
        <li>Dynamic Data: SSR is great for pages with frequently changing data, as they are updated on each request.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Learning SSR in Next.js has made me more aware of the power of server-side rendering and how it can enhance web 
        application performance.
